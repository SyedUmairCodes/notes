# Amazon Q

Amazon Q transforms Amazon QuickSight from a powerful visualization tool into an even more potent **generative business intelligence (GenBI)** solution. It Allows building analyses and data-driven narratives in *minutes* using natural language descriptions. 

Natural language prompts make data access and insight generation possible for users *without technical analytics experience*. Accelerating business pace by enabling a broader range of organizational members to self-serve data needs.

>[!NOTE]
>Q runs on "topics," which are essentially refined datasets. If a dataset is a football player, a topic is that player "fully suited up and ready."

Q automatically generates responses to natural language questions. Q provides helpful suggestions for common questions and guides iterative refinement. Like a consultant, it helps drill down for precise insights. Allows authors to provide tailored generative insights to non-author users (enabling self-service analysis at scale, even across time zones).

Q generates crisp summaries from Q-enabled dashboards to highlight key takeaways for busy leaders. Aggregates multiple analytic sources, including unstructured data (like documentation), into a unified view.

## The Power of NLP in Amazon Q

Amazon Q uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to translate human conversation into data queries, making analytics significantly more accessible and efficient.

Users can ask questions in conversational, everyday language, replacing the need for technical syntax like Microsoft Excel formulas or complex filter configurations and empowers a wider array of users, including those unfamiliar with analytics tools, to make data-driven decisions.

- Business leaders can get immediate answers to their questions without needing an analyst's intervention.
- Analysts and Engineers can focus on more demanding technical tasks.

NLP directly maps natural language questions to data fields and calculates answers. Removing unnecessary middle steps like converting a business question into a technical query and then manually filtering data.
