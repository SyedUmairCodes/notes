# Introduction to Databases

Everything in this world can be considered as data: details about yourself, pictures, apps, and documents stored in your phone and computer. Any transaction you make or trip you take is considered data.

Everything in our world generates data. People store their data in text files, Excel spreadsheets, and paper notebooks. Companies, on the other hand, generate more data than an average person because their employees, day-to-day operations, sales, and all other operations generate data. This data cannot be stored in simple text files or Excel files (though most of the time it is stored in Excel), and this is where databases come in.

Databases, especially relational databases, organize data in tables. Each table is made up of rows and columns and stores data within them. Companies require annual and monthly reports on their operations and spending, and databases allow for quickly finding this information. We can simply ask the database using Structured Query Language (SQL), and the database will return the answer to us.

Databases can handle huge amounts of data. This capability is based on the available storage of the server the database is running on. If you run out of storage, you simply add more to the server, allowing you to have as much storage as needed in your database to cover all your data needs. Companies usually store data in petabytes.

Databases are secure and can only be accessed by individuals who have been granted access. Even then, the administrator can decide which user gets access to what data.

Companies have data in their databases, and multiple employees need to access that data or store additional data in the database. There are several ways to access databases:

- **Direct querying**: You can directly query the database by connecting to it
- **Custom applications**: Develop custom applications or websites that allow employees to run SQL queries using a user-friendly interface
- **Third-party tools**: The database can be accessed by third-party tools like Tableau or Power BI for presenting reports to stakeholders and managers
