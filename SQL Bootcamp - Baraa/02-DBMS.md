# Database Management Systems

However, the database is just a container that stores dataâ€”it cannot fulfill these requests on its own. For this, we use a Database Management System (DBMS). The DBMS handles:

- **Request routing**: Determines which request is coming from where
- **Request prioritization**: Decides what request should be completed first
- **Request classification**: Identifies what kind of request it is
- **Security management**: If a request seems suspicious, the DBMS will reject it
