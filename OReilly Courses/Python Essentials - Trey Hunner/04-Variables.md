# Variables in Python

Python, much like mathematics, utilizes variables to represent values. In Python, a variable is created and assigned a value using the equal sign (=). This is known as an assignment statement. 

A key characteristic of Python is its dynamic typing and lack of explicit variable declaration or initialization. Unlike many other programming languages, you don't need to declare a variable's type or explicitly initialize it before assigning a value; simply using the = operator is sufficient.

Variables in Python are flexible and can be reassigned to new values at any time using the same assignment operator. Python makes no distinction between an initial assignment and a subsequent reassignment.

Beyond merely storing values, variables significantly enhance code readability. Using descriptive variable names can make Python code much easier to understand for other programmers and for one's future self. Variables are a fundamental concept and will be used extensively in Python programming.
