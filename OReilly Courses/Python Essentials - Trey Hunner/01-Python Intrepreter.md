# The Interactive Python Interpreter (REPL)

The Interactive Python Interpreter, also known by several other names such as the Python Shell, Python Prompt, or Python Console, is most commonly referred to as the `Python REPL`. It is the environment you encounter when launching Python directly from a system command prompt without specifying a Python program to execute.

The term REPL is an acronym for Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop, which describes its operational cycle:

- **Read:** Python receives and reads the input typed by the user.
- **Evaluate:** It then evaluates the input, meaning it executes the Python code.
- **Print:** Any value returned by the executed code is printed to the console.
- **Loop:** After printing, the interpreter loops back, waiting for the next input from the user.

This interactive environment allows users to type Python statements, execute them immediately by pressing Enter, and instantly see the results of expressions.

> [!NOTE]
> While the standard command-line interpreter is widely used, other visual or integrated development environments also offer interactive Python interpreters, including IDLE, Jupyter Notebooks, and IPython.
