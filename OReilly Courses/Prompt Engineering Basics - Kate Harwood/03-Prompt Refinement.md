# Refining Prompts for Desired Output

When basic prompting techniques don't yield the desired results, refining prompts becomes crucial. This involves providing more specific and detailed instructions to the generative model.

- Clearly state the desired length.
- Instruct the model on the desired tone or style.
- Give the model relevant background information about the text or task.
- Guide the model to compare new information with existing data .
- Explicitly define the desired output format and headings.

This level of detail, though requiring more effort in prompt construction, significantly increases the likelihood of receiving the exact output desired from the model. Prompt engineering is an iterative process:

- Begin with a basic prompt.
- Evaluate the model's response.
- Adjust the prompt based on the discrepancies between the output and the desired result.
- Continue refining until the output meets expectations.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>During this iterative process, it's important to identify which parts of the prompt are most influential. Even minor wording changes can dramatically alter the output.

## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is another advanced technique for refining model outputs, particularly when dealing with vast amounts of potential contextual information that cannot be directly pasted into a prompt.

- The user provides their original query or prompt to the system.
- Instead of relying solely on the model's pre-trained knowledge, the system first retrieves relevant context from a large external corpus of documents.This context is often stored in "embeddings" for efficient lookup by AI models.
- The retrieved relevant context is then passed along with the original prompt to the generative model.
- The generative model then produces a response that is grounded in the provided context, leading to more accurate, detailed, and specific answers than if it had to rely only on its generalized training data.    

RAG is highly beneficial when:

- The user has a massive amount of potential context that cannot be fully included in a single prompt due to length limitations.
- Pasting too much information into a prompt would lead to "diminishing returns" in model performance, as models can struggle with excessively long inputs.
- The goal is to ensure the model's output is based on specific, up-to-date, or proprietary information not necessarily included in its initial training data.
