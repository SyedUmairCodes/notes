# Introduction to Prompt Engineering

Prompting is the method used to guide a generative AI model to produce a desired output. This can occur within a continuous conversation with a chatbot or as a one-off instruction for a specific result.  The way a prompt is constructed, even with subtle alterations, can significantly influence the model's response.

>While the underlying complexities of generative AI models (such as their architecture and training data) are critical to their quality, the prompt itself can often be equally important in determining the effectiveness and relevance of the output.

The importance of prompting varies with the task. For very simple tasks, such as proofreading an email, the model might understand the intent without much specific instruction. However, for more complex or nuanced tasks, how a user prompts the model becomes paramount to achieving the desired outcome. 

Prompting is described as more of an art than a science, as there are no rigid rules guaranteeing specific results. It is a subtle and constantly evolving field, which has led to the emergence of `prompt engineering` or `prompt designing` as a recognized skill. This skill involves carefully crafting prompts, a process that can take minutes, hours, or even days to perfect, ultimately enabling users to extract precise results from AI models.

## Basic Prompt Strategies

To effectively prompt a generative AI model, several fundamental strategies should be kept in mind:

- Prompts should be clear, unambiguous, and free of vagueness.
- It is essential to include all relevant context that the model might need, as it cannot infer unstated information.
- Users should specify the desired format of the output, including the style of response or the exact structure the output should take.
