# Prompting Examples

Generative AI models are highly versatile and can perform a wide array of tasks. Examples provided include:

- Generating ideas , or creating entire content pieces based on a theme.
- Translating text, with the added ability to specify a particular reading level.
- Image Manipulation/Description:
    - Transforming images .
    - Describing image content.
- Data Transformation:
    - Creating visual diagrams from text.
    - Summarizing large texts.
- Proofreading, rewriting paragraphs in a specific style, adapting technical documents for different audiences.
- Transforming notes into different formats.
- Recreating photos in the style of famous artists, or performing object removal.
- Adding subtitles to videos.
## Prompting Techniques for Generative Models

To effectively guide generative models and obtain desired outputs, several prompting techniques are available:

**Zero-Shot Prompting:**
In zero-shot prompting, the user provides a direct instruction (the prompt) and the input text or data, expecting the model to perform the task without any prior examples. 

**Few-Shot Prompting:**
Few-shot prompting involves providing the model with a task description followed by several examples of input-output pairs. These examples demonstrate the desired behavior or format. After the examples, the user provides the new input for which they want a response. 

**Chain-of-Thought Prompting:**
Chain-of-thought prompting is a technique where, for complex questions (especially those models might struggle with, like math word problems), the prompt includes examples that demonstrate a step-by-step reasoning process. 

**Prompt Chaining:**
Prompt chaining involves breaking down a large, complex task into smaller, sequential prompts. The output from one prompt becomes the input for the next, allowing the model to focus on one sub-task at a time.

- Ask the model only to determine the user's intent.
- Use the classified intent as input for a new prompt that guides the model on the next specific action .

**Reverse Prompting:**
Reverse prompting is a technique where the user asks the model to generate a suitable prompt for a given task and desired output.
