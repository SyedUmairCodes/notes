# Introduction to Data Engineering
Data engineering is about making raw useful for data analysts and data scientists to work on. Organizations typically process data through four general steps:

- Collect and store data from diverse sources
- Clean and prepare data, removing duplicate and missing values
- Exploring data through visualizations and dashboards
- Using the data for business purposes.

Data engineers are primarily responsible for the first step. Their role is foundational, as they lay the groundwork for data analysts, data scientists, and machine learning engineers. Without well-managed, accessible, and uncorrupted data, subsequent steps of preparation, exploration, and experimentation become impossible or severely hindered.

>The core responsibility of a data engineer is to deliver the correct data, in the right format, to the right people, as efficiently as possible. 

Data engineering involves ingesting data from various sources, optimizing databases for analytical purposes, and actively managing data corruption. They are tasked with developing, constructing, testing, and maintaining robust data architectures, including databases and large-scale processing systems, to effectively handle massive amounts of data. 

The advent of big data has significantly increased the demand for data engineers. Big data is characterized as data so extensive that its sheer size poses challenges for traditional data management methods, necessitating specialized approaches. Big data is commonly characterized by five Vs:

- Volume: The sheer quantity of data points.
- Variety: The diverse types and nature of data.
- Velocity: The speed at which data is generated and needs to be processed.
- Veracity: The trustworthiness and accuracy of data sources.
- Value: The potential for the data to provide actionable insights.

## Data Engineer vs. Data Scientist

While both roles are crucial in the data ecosystem, data engineers and data scientists have different primary focuses:

Data Engineers concentrate on the initial stages of the data workflow. Their core responsibility is to ingest and store collected data, ensuring it is easily accessible, well-organized, and ready for analysis by others. They essentially "lay the groundwork" that makes all subsequent data science activities possible.

Data Scientists engage with the latter stages of the data workflow. They prepare data based on their specific analytical needs, explore and visualize it, and then run experiments or build predictive models.

## Data Pipelines

The concept of a "data pipeline" is central to modern data management, much like pipelines are essential for the oil industry. Just as crude oil is extracted, moved to distillation units for processing into various products, and then distributed through a network of pipes to end-users or storage facilities, data follows a similar complex journey within an organization.

Companies ingest raw data from diverse sources, which then needs to be processed, transformed, and stored in various ways. Data pipelines are the automated systems that efficiently manage and automate this flow from one stage to the next, ensuring that data scientists and other users have access to up-to-date, accurate, and relevant data. This complex automation is why data engineers are indispensable.

Data pipelines are crucial for enabling efficient data flow within an organization. They automate the processes of extracting, transforming, combining, validating, and loading data. This automation minimizes human intervention and errors, while also significantly reducing the time it takes for data to become available for use.
### ETL: A Common Framework

A frequently encountered term in data pipeline design is ETL (Extract, Transform, Load). This is a popular framework that breaks down the data flow into three sequential steps:

- Extract data from source.
- Transform and process the data
- Load the data into a new database or warehouse
