# Data Ecosystem

An ecosystem is a large area where similar group of elements interact together. In the data ecosystem, dedicated hardware, specialized software, and data professionals all interact together to find answers and insights hidden in raw data.

Most of the heavy storage now lives in the cloud. Companies dump their data there, data professionals, log in, grab what they need, and turn it into insights the team can act on.

## Tools for Analysis

The most common tools for data analysts is a  spreadsheet software, a database management system, and visualization and business intelligence software.

- Excel or Google sheets
- A SQL based DBMS
- Tableau and Power BI

Spreadsheets are the most commonly used tool when it comes to anything that is related to data. A spreadsheet is made up of rows and columns which make individual cells in the spreadsheet and the cells are where we input our data. The columns are organized by letters and the rows are organized by numbers.

Spreadsheets allows you to manipulate data in more ways than you can imagine, you do simple operations using built in methods or you can create complex custom functions based on your use case

> [!NOTE]
> To work with with databases you'll need to learn the SQL programming language to query and manipulate data in databases and VBA for becoming a power user of Excel. Programming languages like Python and R are also essential tools that you'll need to learn in order to become a good data analyst.

SQL is the primary language used to work with relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL. Relational databases are somewhat similar to spreadsheets as they store data in the same way as a spreadsheet with some differences.

A relational database has multiple tables and each table stores information in rows and columns much like a spreadsheet and you can create relationships between the different tables in a database.

> [!INFORMATION]
>SQL works by using queries and the queries are your commands that you tell the database to do. If you want to retrieve some data you'll use a query that returns the required data to you. All operations like add, delete, and even updating data happens through queries in SQL.

```SQL
SELECT first_name 
FROM customer_data.customer_details 
WHERE first_name = "Bob"
```

Data visualization is an important skill as it allows data analyst to become storytellers and let their data tell stories of the past or future.   Data visuals helps to make sure your reports and findings are understood by other members especially the board of members and other stakeholders.
