# Introduction to Data

Any and everything can be represented as data, even your everyday activities. Tracking sleep, calories, or steps is gathering data, measuring them is analysis and improving based on the measurements is growth.

Our world is filled with unlimited amounts of data that we face overloading amounts of it every single day. New data is being created around us every second and in it's rawest form isn't useful to us but if we collect and analyze data, find patterns and meanings in it then  it becomes more valuable then oil in our day and age.

> Data analysis is the process of making use of our data, that guides businesses towards the right direction based on how and what their users need.

> [!NOTE]
>The roots of data analysis go far in time as when the Egyptians started to use statistics to help them build the pyramids more  easily. The Egyptians were great when it came to organizing and documenting data, they documented all of their data and calculation theories.

Almost everything has a life cycle, and data is no exception. It begins with planning—deciding what we need and how we’ll capture it. Then comes collection, where we pull in large volumes of raw information. 

After that, we clean and analyze it to confirm it’s accurate and meaningful. Once the insights are used to solve the original problem, the data is either archived for future reference or securely destroyed.
