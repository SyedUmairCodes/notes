The equals `=` sign is used to assign a value to a variable and is known as the assignment operator, while double and triple equal signs are used for comparing variables to values. 

```jsx
let a = 1
let b = 2

console.log(a == b)
console.log(a !== b)
```

We can also check if a value is less than the other and vice versa.

```jsx
console.log( a > b) //This will print false because a is less than b
console.log( a < b) //This will print true because a is less than b
```

We can also combine comparison operators if we want to check if a value is less/greater than or equals to a certain value.
