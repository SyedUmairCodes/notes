# The Scrum Team

A scrum team is a cross-functional group of individuals who work together to deliver a product or service. Scrum teams work in sprints, short periods of focused work that produce a useable increment of the product or service they deliver. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> No single individual will take on all of these roles at once, but having an understanding of each of the roles will help you to identify the right people to assign to each role.

## Scrum master

A scrum master ensures that the scrum team are as effective as possible. They assist the product owner, developers, and organization in various ways. They mentor and coach the scrum team, as well as the wider organization,

A scrum master also helps the team identify barriers and blockers and coaches the team to resolve them.

## Developers

A developer within a scrum team is committed to creating a usable increment in each sprint. The specific skills needed by developers are often broad and vary with the type of work they are undertaking. Developers play important roles in achieving sprint goals.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>In scrum, the term “developer” is a simplification. It’s not meant to exclude anyone who isn’t building software. Instead, the term “developer” refers to everyone who contributes to the increment and isn’t assigned another role, like scrum master or product owner.

## Product Owner

The product owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the scrum team's work. Product owners also serve as the bridge between stakeholders and the team and are responsible for defining the product goal and prioritizing the product backlog items.

The product owner plays a crucial role in guiding the scrum team's efforts, ensuring that the product delivers maximum value to customers and the organization.
