# Sprints

A sprint is the heartbeat of scrum. It’s a fixed-length time-box, usually one month or less. during which the scrum team works to deliver a usable, potentially releasable product increment.

At the end of each sprint, the scrum team should have at least one, but potentially many, things that are “done”, meaning it meets the agreed quality standards and is ready for use or release.

> [!NOTE]
> The **definition of done** is a clear and shared understanding of what “done” means for a product increment. This ensures everyone is aligned on quality and completeness.

The scrum team sets the length of a sprint to match the shortest amount of time the team needs (this should not exceed a month) to produce a valuable increment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If a retrospective identifies the sprint duration is a blocker, changing it should be considered but teams should try to be consistent with length to help with planning.

It is recommended that the team spends **as much time as needed** on frequent backlog refinement, ensuring upcoming work is well-understood and ready for future sprints.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Once a sprint starts, its goal is set. No changes should be introduced that would endanger the sprint goal. This focus allows the team to deliver what they committed to, without distractions or shifting priorities.

Only the product owner has the authority to cancel a sprint, and only if the sprint goal becomes obsolete or something emerges that is of higher priority than the sprint goal, making it unachievable. Cancellation is rare, as it disrupts the team’s rhythm and focus.

## Sprint Planning

Sprint planning helps the team lay out the work to be performed in the timebox that follows. This part of the process is all about turning goals into actionable work. During sprint planning, the scrum team collaborates to select items from the product backlog, set a clear sprint goal, and create a plan for delivering those items, which together form the sprint backlog.

Sprint planning is time-boxed to ensure focus. For a one-month sprint, planning should take no longer than eight hours, though this is usually less for a shorter sprint. This forces prioritization and prevents over-planning.

## Kaizen Items

Kaizen is a Japanese business philosophy and continuous improvement approach that focuses on making small, ongoing positive changes to processes, systems, or activities to achieve significant improvements over time.

The kaizen process typically follows the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle, where teams plan a change, implement it on a small scale, evaluate the results, and standardize successful improvements or adjust as needed.

## The daily scrum

The purpose of the daily scrum is to inspect progress toward the sprint goal and adapt the plan for achieving the sprint backlog and sprint goal as necessary.

The daily scrum is a 15-minute event for the scrum team’s developers. To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the sprint. If the product owner or scrum master are actively working on items in the sprint backlog, they participate as developers. The scrum master helps maintain focus and ensures that the timebox is respected and the event is productive.

The developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their daily scrum focuses on progress toward the sprint goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The daily scrum is not the only time developers are allowed to adjust their plan. They often meet throughout the day for more detailed discussions about adapting the rest of the sprint’s work.

## Sprint Review

The purpose of the sprint review is to inspect the outcome of the sprint and determine future adaptations. It is a working session in which the scrum team and stakeholders inspect the product increment and collaborate on what to do next.

The sprint review is the last event of the sprint and should be a maximum of one hour per week of the sprint. 

During the event, the scrum team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the sprint and what has changed in their environment. Unlike a traditional presentation, the sprint review is interactive and focused on feedback and adaptation. It is not just about showing what was done but about discussing progress, challenges, and opportunities.

## Sprint Retrospective

A sprint retrospective is a dedicated meeting held at the end of each sprint. It is the final event in the sprint cycle and a chance for the scrum team to reflect on how they worked together, celebrate successes, and identify opportunities for improvement.

The sprint retrospective is time-boxed to a maximum of three hours for a one-month sprint. For shorter sprints, the event is usually shorter.

The scrum team inspects how the last sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and accomplishing the sprint goal. The scrum team discusses what went well during the sprint, what problems they encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) solved.
