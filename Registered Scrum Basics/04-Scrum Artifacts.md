# Scrum Artifacts

Scrum artifacts are designed to maximize transparency of key information such as progress and upcoming projects, enabling everyone to inspect and adapt work based on the same information.

- The product backlog is the list of items needed to deliver a product.
- The sprint backlog is the list of items needed by the end of the sprint.
- An increment is a measurable step towards the product goal.

>[!NOTE]
>Each artifact has a commitment, or goal, which provides information about what needs to be done and what success looks like, that scrum teams use to measure progress against.

## Delivering a product

A product is a means of delivering value. Organizations can deliver value in a lot of ways:

- A physical product.
- A service to the customer.
- A digital product or experience.

> [!NOTE]
> A  product can be a combination of all of the above, as in the case of a car where a customerâ€™s experience may include driving the vehicle, updating the software digitally, and taking it to the service center for repairs.
