# The Agile Manifesto

The Agile Movement emerged as a response to traditional, rigid project management approaches that often struggled to keep up with changing requirements and customer needs. Rooted in practices that include flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement, agile supports a culture where teams iterate quickly and respond effectively to change. 

> By embracing agile practices, teams can improve productivity, enhance customer satisfaction, and create a more dynamic and innovative working environment.

The Agile Manifesto was created in 2001 by 17 developers who wanted to improve the software development process. They were looking for an alternative to documentation driven, heavyweight software development processes and over the course of 2 days developed the manifesto that is still the center point of agile working today.

- People and their collaboration drive success more than rigid procedures or technologies.
- Delivering functional and valuable products is more important than excessive planning and paperwork.
- Engage with customers throughout the development process and show then every increment and take feedback in order to deliver the best product possible.
- Embrace change and adapt to new requirements rather than strictly adhering to a fixed plan.

> [!NOTE]
> You would need a plan in order to be agile, but the plan must be flexible enough to handle challenges and unexpected opportunities.

## Twelve Principles of Agile
The Agile Manifesto isn’t just about values, it’s backed by twelve principles that guide how teams operate. These principles emphasize continuous delivery, sustainable development, simplicity, and self-organizing teams.

- Customer satisfaction is the number one priority.
- Welcome changes throughout the development process.
- Deliver working products in a month or few weeks.
- Collaboration between teams, stakeholders, and product owners is crucial.
- Give your team the motivation it needs to work comfortably and productively.
- Focus on open communication.
- Working product is the only measure of success.
- Keep focusing on the details throughout the process.
- Keep processes and requirements simple
- Self-organizing teams are the most effective teams.
- Self reflection should be done after every sprint.
