# Introduction to Scrum

Scrum is a framework teams can use to create better outcomes. Scrum shifts your mindset from working for an individual or a customer toward working for a team that holds the power to make meaningful change for the customer. Ultimately, everything you do within scrum creates change using the power of collaboration within a team, and each team member needs to embody the scrum values throughout the process.

Think of scrum as a way for your team to work in small pieces. With scrum, your team can think and work critically throughout, making changes and improvements as you go. Continuous experimentation and feedback loops along the way allow you to learn and improve.

When work is broken into smaller pieces, you can deliver value incrementally, adapt quickly to change, and prioritize collaboration and feedback. Scrum can be tailored to different industries and types of work while maintaining its core principles.

## The Team and Sprints

A scrum team includes a scrum master, product owner, developers or team members working together in iterative cycles called sprints. While you can implement parts of scrum theory to make improvements to collaboration and workflow, youâ€™ll get the most benefit using the entire scrum framework.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Teams that use scrum start with the basic framework and review processes regularly to continuously improve while retaining core practices such as daily meetings and retrospectives.

Scrum can be adapted to any industry or team but the core principles remain the same:

- Open collaboration
- Self-organizing teams
- Value-based prioritization
- Iterative development    
- Continuous improvement
- Time boxing
