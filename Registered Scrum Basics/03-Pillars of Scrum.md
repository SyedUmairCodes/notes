# The Pillars of Scrum

Scrum’s foundation is based on empirical process control, which rests on three fundamental pillars: transparency, inspection, and adaptation. Empirical process control enables scrum teams to deliver high-quality products while remaining agile and responsive to change.

- Transparency ensures that all aspects of the work are clear to every member of the team.
- Inspection means regular evaluation of progress towards goals.
- Adaptation is the ability to make necessary adjustments based on the results of inspection.

> [!NOTE]
> Adaptation occurs throughout scrum events. Whenever a scrum team finds something unacceptable or identifies opportunities for improvement, they adjust the process.

Adopting scrum can be a big change in the way a team works or a product is produced, and understanding how the pillars are applied to your daily process will make it much easier to successfully navigate transformation.

## Parts of Scrum

- The scrum board is a good example of transparency. All work items are visible to the entire team, showing what's planned, in progress, and completed. 
- The daily scrum is a meeting where the team gathers represents inspection and adaptation.
- A sprint burndown chart shows the amount of work that has been completed in a sprint, and the total work remaining. 

## Scrum Values

The scrum values are commitment, focus, openness, respect, and courage. They guide the behavior and decision-making of scrum team members, fostering a collaborative and productive environment.

- Team members commit to achieving the scrum team’s goals and supporting each other.
- The team's primary focus should be on the sprint’s work and making the best possible progress towards the sprint goal.
- The team and its stakeholders must be open about the work and any challenges they encounter.
- The team embraces challenges and is willing to work on tough problems. Individuals can voice their opinions and tackle difficult issues.
