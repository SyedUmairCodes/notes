# Chapter Two: Arrays

In Computers, memory (RAM) can be thought of as a modular shelf that has removable drawers. Each variable in your code is a drawer and it's value is the things you store in that drawer. The maximum shelf space determines the amount of drawers that can be added at a time, the drawers can be of any shape and size as long as they fit in the shelf. If we need to store one item in one drawer then we can only have a limited number of drawers. 

That's where array's come in. An array is a data structure that holds multiple entries accessed by index. Array's are used when you need to store, iterate over, or manipulate a collection of values of (roughly) the same type without knowing much about how the individual values are correlated. 

>[!NOTE]
> An array is an indexed collection of data. Meaning that an array stores a sequence of items (usually calledÂ _elements_), and you only can access them by their position (also known as their index).

Some languages have arrays that are static and some languages have dynamic arrays. The difference is that the size of the can not be changed at run time or be changed respectively.
