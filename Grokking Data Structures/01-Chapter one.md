# Chapter One: Introduction

> [!NOTE]
> Data structures make the world go round: information is the gold of the Internet Age, and data structures are necessary for handling and making sense of information. Data structures allow us to shape data in meaningful ways and query it to find what is relevant to us.

Data structures as the name suggests are ways to store and organize data so we can easily access or manipulate it. They are extremely useful in your everyday work even if you aren't in a technical field, you still use them everyday in almost all the tasks you do.

In our times, we are flooded with information and always overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information we need to process on a daily basis. Learning data structures will help you organize the important information and discard the useless.

> [!NOTE]
> The term data structure is often used with algorithms, since they are closely related people assume their the same thing which is not correct.
> 
> - An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions esigned to solve a specific problem or perform a particular task.
> - A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data. It defines the relationship between the data elements, the operations that can be performed, and the rules or constraints for accessing and modifying the data.
> 
> Some data structures are specifically designed to allow the efficient execution of certain algorithms, such as hash tables for key-based search.
